# Draw-to-learn-science

### Introduction
A project to study whether drawing is a useful strategy to learn about abstract scientific concepts. In two notebooks, I analyze data collected from 500 individuals who participated in one of two experiments on ths topic. Participants were randomly assigned to either study or copy an instructor-created drawing, complete a scaffolded drawing worksheet, or to draw on a blank sheet of paper while reading about an abstract concept or a physical system. We found evidence that drawing without guidance most effectively encourages retention but not transfer when the lesson is abstract. Drawing did not encourage retention or transfer when the lesson was on a physical system.

- The purpose of Experiment 1 was to test whether greater illustration generativity would benefit retention and transfer of a passage about an abstract scientific phenomena. We predicted that retention and transfer performance would improve as participants generated more of their own illustration. If this were true, we would expect participants who studied a drawing provided to them to perform the worst on both measures of comprehension and for participants who drew their own illustration to perform the best. 


`Experiment2.ipynb`
- The purpose of Experiment 2 was to replicate the finding that students benefit from guidance when drawing to learning about a physical system. We predicted that retention and transfer performance would be the highest in the complete condition because this is the condition in which the most guidance was provided during the drawing process. Moreover, we predicted that retention and transfer would be higher in the drawing condition compared to the copying and studying conditions because the act of producing a drawing from scratch is thought to improve memory. We did not expect significant differences between the copying and studying conditions.
