# Draw-to-learn-science

A project to study whether drawing is a useful strategy to learn about abstract scientific concepts. In two notebooks, I analyze data collected from 500 individuals who participated in one of two experiments on ths topic. Participants were randomly assigned to either study or copy an instructor-created drawing, complete a scaffolded drawing worksheet, or to draw on a blank sheet of paper while reading about an abstract concept or a physical system. We found evidence that drawing without guidance most effectively encourages retention but not transfer when the lesson is abstract. Drawing did not encourage retention or transfer when the lesson was on a physical system.
